Is going to be a surprisingly easy piece of software, to provide animation and real time DJing for demoscene parameters.

Demoscene is recorded as a stage (ステージ！)  >⩊<  with checkpoints and you can DJ it and remaster on the fly.

This piece of software control de variables and animation curves that are sent to the external rendering engine (via pipes, shared heap, sockets, whatever...)

Aims are for this to be SIMD optimized and also being developed along a extensive benchmarking to optimize asigned threads and cores — easier than it sounds.

Odin is the language of choice but Nim is also on the look
